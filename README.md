# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Implementation in TensorFlow

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator trained adversarially to generate synthetic data.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Model Architecture

- **Generator**: A deep neural network that learns to generate realistic data samples from random noise.
- **Discriminator**: A deep neural network that learns to distinguish real data from fake (generated) data.
- **Loss Function**: Binary cross-entropy loss is used for both the generator and discriminator.
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer is used for both models.

## Training Details

- The model is trained using adversarial training, where the generator and discriminator compete against each other.
- The training process consists of alternating updates to the generator and discriminator.
- The generator aims to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to correctly classify real vs. fake samples.
- Training is performed for **20 epochs**, but it is recommended to train for **1000-2000 epochs** for optimal results.

## How to Run

1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`gan.ipynb`).
2. Run all the cells sequentially to train the model.
3. The training process will generate images at different epochs to visualize the learning progress.

## Results and Improvements

- The generated images improve over time as the GAN continues training.
- For better results, increase the number of epochs to **1000-2000**.
- Experiment with different network architectures, learning rates, and batch sizes for improved performance.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement conditional GAN (cGAN) for class-specific image generation.
- Use Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) to improve stability.
- Apply techniques like spectral normalization and progressive growing for high-quality image generation.
